* calculateSquare takes an array of numbers, squares the values and returns void
* increment takes an array of numbers, and increments each by 1 and does not return anythin
* doubleIt takes an array of numbers and doubles each and returns void

***squaring (9, 25, 100)
***incrementing  (10, 26, 101)
***doubling (20, 52, 202)
